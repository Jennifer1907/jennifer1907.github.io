  <div class="post-content">
    <div class="container--narrow">
      <p>Five years ago I was a nervous intern at Capital One, trying to figure out how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JOIN</code> worked in SQL. Today I’m a Senior Data Analyst at Stripe, leading a team and presenting to VPs. Here’s what actually moved the needle—and what I wasted time on.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-got-right">What I Got Right</h2>

<h3 id="1-i-learned-to-communicate-before-i-learned-to-model">1. I learned to communicate before I learned to model</h3>

<p>The single biggest separator between mid-level and senior analysts isn’t technical skill—it’s the ability to translate a complex finding into a clear business recommendation.</p>

<p>Early in my career I gave an 18-slide deck full of confidence intervals to a VP who wanted to know: <em>should we expand to the UK market?</em> He stopped me after slide 3.</p>

<p>I rebuilt the presentation as: problem → recommendation → evidence. Three slides. He approved the project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The goal of analysis is a decision, not a deliverable.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="2-i-picked-depth-over-breadth-in-my-second-year">2. I picked depth over breadth in my second year</h3>

<p>The temptation as a new analyst is to learn everything: SQL, Python, R, Tableau, Power BI, Spark, Looker, dbt…</p>

<p>I got much more value from going deep on Python + SQL + one BI tool than from being mediocre at everything. When you’re the team’s Python expert, people come to you. When you’re “okay at everything,” people go to the specialist.</p>

<h3 id="3-i-got-close-to-a-domain">3. I got close to a domain</h3>

<p>At Shopify I specialised in merchant health. I became the person who understood churn inside out—not just the models, but <em>why</em> merchants leave, what interventions work, what the product team was trying to do. That context made my analysis 10x more useful than technically superior work done without it.</p>

<h3 id="4-i-built-in-public-sort-of">4. I built in public (sort of)</h3>

<p>Writing internal write-ups of my analyses, sharing findings in Slack, volunteering to present at data team all-hands—all of these compounded my visibility over time. People outside my immediate team started tagging me when they had data questions.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-wasted-time-on">What I Wasted Time On</h2>

<h3 id="chasing-certifications-before-building-projects">Chasing certifications before building projects</h3>

<p>I spent three months of evenings on a cloud certification that nobody has ever asked me about in an interview. The project I built the month after that—a churn model for a nonprofit using Kaggle data—came up in every subsequent conversation.</p>

<p>Build things. Then document them. The certification is the resume line; the project is the interview.</p>

<h3 id="perfecting-analyses-nobody-read">Perfecting analyses nobody read</h3>

<p>I once spent two weeks refining a segmentation model. By the time I was done, the product team had already made the decision it was supposed to inform.</p>

<p>Ship an 80% analysis on time, then iterate. A good-enough answer today beats a perfect answer next month.</p>

<h3 id="optimising-for-title-vs-learning">Optimising for title vs learning</h3>

<p>I turned down a senior analyst role at a small company to stay at Shopify as an analyst II, because I knew I’d learn more from the Shopify infrastructure and team. Two years later I got promoted to senior and then lateral-hired at Stripe at a higher level than the role I’d turned down.</p>

<p>Optimise for slope, not intercept.</p>

<h2 id="the-skills-that-actually-got-me-hired">The Skills That Actually Got Me Hired</h2>

<p>Every recruiter screen, every final round, every hiring manager I’ve talked to cared about:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>SQL proficiency</strong> — this is table stakes at any data role. Window functions, CTEs, query optimisation.</li>
  <li><strong>Storytelling with data</strong> — can you explain a complex finding simply?</li>
  <li><strong>Business intuition</strong> — can you connect the data to a business outcome?</li>
  <li><strong>Technical curiosity</strong> — are you self-teaching, staying current, building things?</li>
</ol>

<p>Python and ML were nice-to-haves that differentiated me once I was through the door. They weren’t what got me in.</p>

<h2 id="advice-id-give-my-2019-self">Advice I’d Give My 2019 Self</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Find a senior analyst whose work you admire and ask to review your work with them monthly. Most people will say yes.</li>
  <li>Write up your analyses even when nobody asks. The habit of documenting decisions is worth its weight in gold.</li>
  <li>Develop a point of view. Analysts who only report what the data says are replaceable. Analysts who say “here’s what I think we should do, and here’s why” become indispensable.</li>
  <li>Your first company matters less than the people you learn from there.</li>
</ul>
